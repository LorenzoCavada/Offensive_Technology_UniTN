# Offensive Technology UniTN

This repository contains all the exercises I have completed during the Offensive Technology course 2021/2022 helded by Fabio Massacci and Giorgio Di Tizio at the University of Trento.  
All the materials here have been produced exclusively by myself except for the [Snort](https://github.com/LorenzoCavada/Offensive_Technology_UnitTN/tree/main/Snort) exercise that has been produced in collaboration with Tommaso Sacchetti.

Some advice about the course itself, the lessons are good but mostly useless, you will have to do everything by yourself. You will have the opportunity to tackle a lot of different technologies and systems.  
If you are in doubt I would recommend following this course but be prepared because you will need to invest into it quite a big amount of time during the semester while you will be basically free during the winter session.

Also prepare because the grading system is illogic and is very important to do a good initial test or you will be penalized at the end of the course. 4 points of your final grade, indeed, will be based on the level of your knowledge _BEFORE_ starting the course which seems so irational to me but this is what it is.

I hope it can help you, I would have like to have something like this. If you find errors or for any other problems feel free to contact me at this email: lorenzo.cavada1@gmail.com

Bye
