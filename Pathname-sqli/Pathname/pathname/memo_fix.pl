	# the star '*' is a wildcard. This is a "glob" operator -- it finds
	# all the files in the 'memo' directory in any home directory located
	# in /home. E.g., it finds files in /home/foo/memo/ and /home/bar/memo
	# and stores them in a 0-indexed array (Perl arrays start with @).
	my @memos = </home/*/memo/*>; # all regular users

	# GET ROOT'S MEMOS
	# root can also have memos in /home/root/. The next glob operator
	# "pushes" root's memos onto the @memos array. This script (memo.cgi)
	# needs SUID-root permissions to access files in /root/memo.
	push (@memos, </root/memo/*>); # special memos from root

		# iterate through all memos listed in @memos. Each time
		# through this for-like loop, the memo's path will be stored
		# in the variable '$memo'. The 'foreach' loop will end after
		# the last memo is processed.

		# the following line is a "regular expression" which matches
		# the filename at the end of a path and stores the filename (only)
		# in the special variable "$1". E.g., if the path /foo/memo/i_quit
		# is in $memo, the string "i_quit" will be in $1 after the regular
		# expression.
		$memo =~ m#^.+/([^/]+)$#; # regex extract filename
		my $memoname = $1; # store the memoname part into $memoname
		$memoname =~ s/_/ /g; # turn memoname "i_quit" into "i quit"
		$labels{$memo} = $memoname; # assign pretty label name

		# $labels{'/foo/memo/i_quit'} pointing to the string "i quit"
