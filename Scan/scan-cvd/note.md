# HOST DISCOVERY USING NMAP

### Command:
    sudo nmap -sn 5.6.7.0/24

### OUTPUT:

    Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-23 01:06 PDT
    Nmap scan report for server-link1 (5.6.7.8)
    Host is up (0.00040s latency).
    Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (1 host up) scanned in 37.34 seconds


### OBSERVATION:
If no host discovery options are given, Nmap sends an ICMP echo request, a TCP SYN packet to port 443, a TCP ACK packet to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request.

# SCANNING FIRST 1500 PORTS ON 5.6.7.8

### COMMAND:

    sudo nmap -p 1-1500 -sS 5.6.7.8

### OUTPUT:

    Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-23 01:52 PDT
    Nmap scan report for server-link1 (5.6.7.8)
    Host is up (0.00023s latency).
    Not shown: 1497 filtered ports
    PORT     STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp   open  ssh
    80/tcp   open  http
    1212/tcp open  lupa
    
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.41 seconds

### OBSERVATION:

No difference can be seen in the two scans. Of course in the first scan all the ports have been scanned and it required much more time. Anyways usually not all the ports are tested but just the most used. This can be done using the â€“F options of nmap, in this case the port 1212 will not be displayed because is not a port usually used.

# SCANNING FIRST 1500 PORTS ON 5.6.7.8 USIN XMAS SCAN

### COMMAND:

    sudo nmap -p 1-1500 -sX 5.6.7.8

### OUTPUT:

    Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-23 02:00 PDT
    Nmap scan report for server-link1 (5.6.7.8)
    Host is up (0.00026s latency).
    Not shown: 1496 closed ports
    PORT     STATE         SERVICE
    22/tcp   open|filtered ssh

    1212/tcp open|filtered lupa
    
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 146.88 seconds

### OBSERVATION:

The TCP RFC state that packets sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set should be dropped and no response send.
By performing this scan nmap does not receive an aswer for the open ports meaning that the port can be or open or the traffic filtered.

# SCANNING FIRST 1500 PORTS ON 5.6.7.8 USIN TCP ACK SCAN

### COMMAND:

    sudo nmap -p 1-1500 -sA 5.6.7.8

#OUTPUT:

    Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-23 02:05 PDT
    Nmap scan report for server-link1 (5.6.7.8)
    Host is up (0.00019s latency).
    All 1500 scanned ports on server-link1 (5.6.7.8) are unfiltered
    
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.66 seconds

### OBSERVATION:

Due to the fact that all the ports are unfiltered we can assume that the firewall apply an "allow per default" policy or that the filter is stateless.
A stateful firewall can determine if an incoming ACK packet is part of an established outgoing connection. It only blocks the packet if it is unsolicited as in the case of the the ACK SCAN performed by nmap which would, in the case of blocked packets, label the port as filtered.

### OBSERVATION:

I'm able to reach the host inside the network throw the port 80 for http traffic or directly connect to it throw ssh at port 22 which does not require authentication.
